# Data Engineering with dbt - Code Samples
This repository contains code samples for the book Data Engineering with dbt.

## Organization of this Repository
This is not the repository for the dbt project used as a sample in the book.
At the end of this readme you have a small discussion of [the sample dbt project](#the-sample-dbt-project) 

The files in this repo represents the evolution of the code as discussed in the different chapters of the book.
Because of that the files are organized by book chapter.

When one source file undergoes many substantial changes in a chapter we have provided multiple versions of the file to
represent the multiple stages discussed in the chapter.

### Samples from the introductory chapters
In the first chapters we introduce Snowflake and dbt and the samples are about snippets of code, 
so we have provided one file per section as often individual snippets are too tiny to justify a single file per sample.
Longer samples can be in their own file.

### Code from the remaining chapters
In chapter 5 we start the sample dbt project and from that point onward each file in this repo represents
one version of a file in the dbt project.

In the early phases of the sample project we have few models
