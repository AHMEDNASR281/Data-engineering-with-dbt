# Welcome to the Portfolio tracking dbt project!

This is sample project built with dbt and Snowflake used in the book "Data Architecture with dbt".

## Project description

An investor has portfolios at different brokers where he holds positions in securities. 
He can buy and sell securities, therefore opening, closing and changing the positions he has. 
He would like to be able to provide the data he receives from the brokers to track the daily value of his overall situation 
and analyse his holdings according to multiple attributes of the securities.
